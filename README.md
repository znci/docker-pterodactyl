# docker-pterodactyl

This is a fork of [EdyTheCow/pterodactyl-docker](https://github.com/EdyTheCow/pterodactyl-docker) with some changes to make it work behind an already existing reverse proxy. In our case, NGINX.

You're welcome to use this, but it's modified for our own use case. It's been modified to work like a
development environment, so it's not recommended to use this in production.
